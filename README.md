linuxProgrammFinder
===================
This programm is a commandline tool for linux. It expact a programmname to search for.
The $PATH variable is read and the programe is searched in every folder. I recognize that this program does the same like the program "which" does, that is shipped with every linux. But it was only an one hour hack so it does not matter.
